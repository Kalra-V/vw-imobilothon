## About This Project

This is a prototype of the ML model for our idea of brake shoe replacement prediction.

Since we do not currently have a working model to gather real sensor data, we simulate the data by randomly generating it. This simulated sensor data is then processed using the model designed for this project. Based on the results from the model, relevant alerts are generated as part of the system's functionality.
